## How To ...  write articles for TheSmiths

### Logistics
First of all, clone the repository with : `git clone
https://github.com/thesmiths/thesmiths.github.io.git`

Then, create a post using `./createArticle <title>`. It assume that **Node.js** is installed and
correctly configured on your machine. In case of trouble, install **Node.js** first and try again.

Now you can edit your article which has been placed in the *_posts* folder. See the section below
for more information about editing and writing an article. 

Once everything is done, just commit and publish your change by doing :

- `git add _posts`
- `git commit -m <messageThatExplainThePurposeOfTheArticle>`
- `git push origin master`

> You can commit your change all along your writing and only publish all changes at the end.
